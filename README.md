XFCE in a Fedora 20 Docker container
====================================

What
----

Simple proof of concept to run Fedora 20 desktop in a container.  Forked from jumanjiman/xrdp, removed scap added Firefox.


Why
---

I want to run a graphical Linux app, such as `firefox`,
and access it from devices that cannot run an X Server,
such as a stock Chromebook or Windows laptop.

I may extend https://github.com/jumanjiman/wormhole to provide
a full desktop along the lines of xrdp.


Run
---

On a Linux host with Docker:

    docker run -d -p 3389:3389 amaline/docker-xrdp

Connect to the container as user `foo` with password `bar`
via an RDP client, such as the [Ericom AccessToGo Chrome App]
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accesstogo-fastest-free-r/pdeelgamlgannhelgoegilelnnojegoh).


Build
-----

On a Linux host with Docker:

    docker build --rm -t amaline/docker-xrdp .
